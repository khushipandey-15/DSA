C++ Array Operations and Algorithms
This repository contains multiple C++ programs focusing on array operations, 2D array manipulations, searching, sorting, and common algorithms. Each file demonstrates a specific concept or functionality, making it a great resource for learning and practicing array-related coding problems.

File Descriptions:
2DARRAY.cpp

Demonstrates basic operations on 2D arrays.
Includes user input, traversal, and row-wise or column-wise processing.
add.cpp

Implements addition of two arrays or matrices.
Useful for understanding matrix arithmetic and nested loops.
array.cpp

Covers basic array operations such as insertion, traversal, and displaying elements.
Ideal for beginners learning one-dimensional arrays.
manytoone.cpp

Implements techniques to combine multiple arrays into a single array.
Useful for solving problems involving merging or concatenating arrays.
max.cpp

Finds the maximum element in an array.
Demonstrates traversal and comparison logic in arrays.
min.cpp

Finds the minimum element in an array.
Highlights the same logic as max.cpp but for finding the smallest value.
pairsum.cpp

Finds pairs of elements in an array whose sum matches a given value.
Demonstrates nested loops and conditional logic for pair-finding problems.
search.cpp

Implements searching algorithms like linear search or binary search.
Useful for understanding how to locate specific elements efficiently in arrays.
sort0-1.cpp

Sorts an array of 0s and 1s.
Demonstrates efficient sorting techniques for binary arrays.
tripletsum.cpp

Finds triplets in an array that add up to a given target sum.
An important concept for solving advanced array problems.
unionarray.cpp

Implements the union operation between two arrays.
Covers merging and removing duplicates to create a combined array.
vectorarray.cpp

Demonstrates the use of the C++ vector container.
Covers operations like insertion, deletion, traversal, and dynamic resizing.

Topics Covered:
Array Basics: Traversal, insertion, and searching.
Matrix Operations: Addition, row-wise and column-wise processing.
Sorting and Searching: Binary search, sorting arrays with constraints.
Pair and Triplet Problems: Solving problems using nested loops or efficient algorithms.
Vector Operations: Dynamic arrays and their manipulation in C++.
Set Operations: Union and intersection of arrays.
Purpose:
This repository is intended for:
