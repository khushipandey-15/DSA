Key Features:
User-Friendly Input/Output:
The program is interactive, taking input directly from the user and providing clear output.
Use of Nested Loops:
Both user input and array traversal utilize nested loops for matrix-like operations.
Modular Function Design:
Row-wise sum calculation is handled in a separate function (printsumwisearray), promoting code reuse and clarity.
Purpose:
This code is an excellent example for:

Learning how to handle 2D arrays in C++.
Understanding nested loops and their application in matrix operations.
Demonstrating modular programming with functions.
